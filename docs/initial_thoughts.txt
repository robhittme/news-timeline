I want to build an application what is a nod to what i wanted to create originally.  This is a timeline of events on a given topic.

For example, if you would like to know more about the situation in urkaine, you would want to dig in but figuring out the time line is difficult. 

So the point of this applcation is for you search for a topic and then organize the articles in order of timeline. 



Determine a single api to use at first. 
build out the basic flow
    - input a topic, date range (optional)
    - search for topic
    - return results in date order

This will not require a database at first.  More to consider later. 

I would like there to be a CLI for this application
I would like to build a frontend timeline view for this as well.
I think it would be worth exploring in react native
